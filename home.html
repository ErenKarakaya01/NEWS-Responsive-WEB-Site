            <br>Philadelphia, who are seeking their first NBA championship since 1983, are looking to earn the top seed and home court advantage in the post-season and Wednesday's win gives them the upper hand, at least for now, over the second-place Nets.
            <br>The 76ers improved to 38-17 on the season, just one game ahead of Brooklyn at 37-18.
            <br>Embiid also shot 13-of-29 from the floor and pulled down 13 rebounds as the 76ers saw their 22 point lead slashed to just three in the fourth.

            <br>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) is in talks with the British Film Institute (BFI) to use the latter’s cinema complex, BFI Southbank, as part of the forthcoming Oscars ceremony, according to a report in Variety.
            <br>Citing “multiple sources”, Variety says that Ampas is looking to use BFI Southbank, in London’s Waterloo, as one of the international “hubs” for its awards show, which is due to take place on Sunday 25 April in Los Angeles.
            <br>Ampas was forced to change tack from its original plans for a “no Zoom” show after complaints that non-US based nominees would not be able to attend due to Covid regulations, and instead decided to set up a series of overseas event locations to allow participation for those unable to travel. France will have a “hub” at a studio in Paris.
